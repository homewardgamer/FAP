        <div class="faq-content">
            <p>Ans- The Flexible Academic Program (FAP) is a framework which ensures smooth flow of an admitted student
                towards PhD allowing several Midway Exit options with highly simplified Reentry Mechanism using its
                Academic Bank of Credits (ABC). Flexible Fee, Multi-mode, Multilanguage medium, Continuous Assessment,
                Multi-institute movement, holistic approach etc. suggestions given in the NEP2020 have been integrated
                with FAP.</p>

        <div class="faq-content">
            <p>Ans- It is to be defined by the individual institutes or the consortium head. During pilot run, the

                of respective consortium e.g. in IITs consortium (whenever it become active) it may be via JEE Advanced,
                whereas in NIT/IIITs consortium (whenever it become active) it may be via JEE Mains. Similar process may
                be followed at PG level admissions.</p>
